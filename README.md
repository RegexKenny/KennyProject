Hi all,

This repository is the full code of a question I asked on Stack Overflow. The question can be accessed by https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52473094/wpf-update-database-of-selected-object-by-textbox-input-in-datatemplate-via-two

The main problem right now is that I cannot update the database with my input for a selected Component object. The SelectedObject in the PartViewModel.cs turns to null after I lose focus of the ListBox.  

The database I am using is sqlite-net-pcl. And you may also need to install Fluent.Ribbon to run the program.

BTW: It must be confessed that there are many issues with my code, but what I want is a workable program for the main functions first, and then I will fix all other problems later on.

Any solution or advice is welcome. Thank you!
